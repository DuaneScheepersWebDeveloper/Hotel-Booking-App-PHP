# HotelBookingApp
This is a PHP built application that is built primarily with PHP code, HTML,CSS and some Javascript.

 
## Description

This application comprises of two parts an admin section and a user section. Depending on what you register yourself as will take you to either the admin or user section.

As a user, you are able to:

- [x] Register and/or login
- [x] Add Hotels to your basket.
- [x] Make bookings
- [x] View bookings
- [x] Edit bookings
- [x] Add information on the booking (such as how many nights, how many people will be staying). For simplicity both adult and child are charged the same.
- [x] You can choose to view more hotels in accommodations if you don't want whats in home. 
- [x] You can send a message.
- [x] You can change the status of payment via the admin side of the application.
- [x] You can add additional Hotels to your database via the admin side of the application
- [x] You can delete your bookings and basket transactions


What I want to add in the future:
- [ ] Stricter validation all around
- [ ] be able to cancel within 48hrs



## Using the site/app

- Please find the export "oop-hotel-booking-app-login-db.sql" of the database in the folder path **/db/**
- Import the database so that you may use it with your MAMP or XAMP software and PHP MyAdmin with this project
- Additionally, copy the folder to your htdocs folder and host it via your MAMP or XAMP software and then put this URL in your favorite browser to view the application:

You will need to either login or register first.<br>

For testing purposes, please use these creds to test admin login feature (admin role): admin@admin | admin

For testing purposes, please use these creds to test user login feature (user role): test@test | test

Alternatively, create a user account and you will be directed to the home page!
